# Overview

## How to navigate the source code
Bitcrafte engine is a modular game engine made of several components.

Best place to start is by looking at the overview of each of the [engine components](Engine_Components/index.md) first. Each component is mostly self contained and name should give a good idea of what area each component focuses on, however some components depend directly on other components so before working on any single component, check the dependencies listing.

A good place to start is the [Core](Engine_Components/Core.md) component as almost everything else depends on it.
