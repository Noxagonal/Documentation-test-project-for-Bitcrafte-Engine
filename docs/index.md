# Bitcrafte Engine
Bitcrafte engine is a 3D game engine written in modern C++. I'm developing primarily for myself. My plan is to build a "proper" game engine from the ground up, make it easy to use, resistant to crashes and intuitive to use.

## Purpose
This is primarily a passion project, meant to amuse myself, however I hope it will be useful to others as well some day.

## Current development status
Most of the foundation work is done, currently I'm writing some low level functions in the core. I'm still figuring out a few things as I go, nothing is final yet.
